Duke Point O helps you keep track of mundane tasks so that you can free your brain
~~and let them rot~~ for greater stuff!

Who doesn't like task list??
Everybody needs one!
- [ ] Do me
- [ ] Do me!
- [ ] Do me!!

### What it can do
- Add task
- Mark task as done
- Delete task
- Okay I know it sounds boring already
- but I assure you it is **AWESOME**!!1!
- And many more...

### In future release
- [ ] Read your mind and automatically input tasks
- [ ] Do the tasks for you
- [ ] Solve world hunger

### Try it (at your own risk)!
1. Go to my recent [release](https://github.com/bklimey/ip/releases/tag/A-Jar) and download `ip.jar`
1. Open command prompt in the same folder as `ip.jar` and enter `java -jar ip.jar` into the command prompt
1. Run it and have fun!
